# Roo Code 3.29.5 Release Notes (2025-11-01)

This patch improves code search reliability with Qdrant and ensures accurate usage and cost reporting across providers.


## Bug Fixes

* Qdrant codebase_search reliability: Indexes the type field to prevent errors when using Qdrant hosted instances (thanks rossdonald!) ([#8964](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8964))
* Accurate cost and token tracking across providers: Ensures consistent usage metrics and billing in Roo Code Cloud dashboards ([#8954](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8954))
