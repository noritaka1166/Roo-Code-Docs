## New models and caching: Moonshot kimi‑k2‑thinking and MiniMax‑M2‑Stable

kimi‑k2‑thinking: Moonshot's latest & best‑performing model. Plus MiniMax‑M2‑Stable with prompt caching to cut latency and cost on repeated prompts (thanks nokaka!) ([#9079](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9079), [#9072](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9072)).

## UI and workflow improvements

We’ve batched several UX updates to make everyday use smoother ([#9057](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9057), [#8932](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8932), [#8965](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8965), [#9003](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9003)):

- Home screen: cleaner left‑aligned layout, clearer recent history (up to 4), tips auto‑dismiss after 6 tasks, improved spacing on large windows.
- Diff view in chat: unified format with line numbers and inline added/removed counts for faster, more accurate reviews.
- Settings clarity: setting Error & Repetition Limit to 0 explicitly disables that safety mechanism, avoiding unexpected auto‑stops.
- Mode import flow: after importing a mode, Roo auto‑switches to it; if the mode data hasn’t loaded yet, Roo briefly falls back to Architect mode to avoid UI desync.

Together these reduce clicks, improve readability, and make behavior more predictable.

## Bug Fixes

* Auto‑retry on empty assistant response to prevent task cancellations (reporter: Akillatech) ([#9083](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9083))
* Use “system” role for non‑streaming OpenAI‑compatible requests to prevent provider errors (reporter: whitfin) ([#8216](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8216))
* Prevent notification sound when messages are queued to auto‑continue ([#8540](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8540))
