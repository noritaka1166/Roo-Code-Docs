This release adds Smart Code Folding so context condensing preserves a lightweight map of the code you were working on.

## Smart Code Folding

When Roo condenses a long conversation, it now keeps a lightweight “code outline” for recently used files—things like function signatures, class declarations, and type definitions—so you can keep referring to code accurately after condensing without re-sharing files. (thanks shariqriazz!) ([#10942](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10942))

> **📚 Documentation**: See [Intelligent Context Condensing](/features/intelligent-context-condensing) for details on configuring and using context condensing.
