# Roo Code 3.37.1 Release Notes (2025-12-23)

This release refreshes the signup flow, improves tool-calling reliability for OpenAI-compatible providers, and fixes several chat reliability issues.

## QOL Improvements

* Improves tool-calling reliability for Roo Code Cloud by preventing tool-result metadata (like `environment_details`) from interrupting tool call sequences ([#10301](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10301))
* Improves tool-calling reliability across OpenAI-compatible providers by merging trailing tool-result text into the last tool message, reducing cases where tool call sequences get interrupted ([#10299](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10299))

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where Roo could show errors when a provider returned an empty assistant message by retrying once and only showing an error if the problem repeats ([#10297](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10297))
* Fixes an issue where OpenAI/OpenAI-compatible chats could fail to use native tools when custom model info didn’t explicitly set tool support, by sending native tool definitions by default ([#10314](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10314))
* Fixes an issue where Roo could send malformed `reasoning_details` data after transforming conversation history, preventing provider-side errors and improving compatibility with OpenAI Responses-style reasoning blocks ([#10313](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10313))
* Fixes an issue where “ask” flows could hang if your reply was queued instead of being delivered as an ask response, so conversations continue reliably ([#10315](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10315))

## Misc Improvements

* **Provider-centric signup**: Makes Roo easier to get started with by defaulting the welcome/sign-up flow to the Roo provider (while keeping other providers available), so you can reach a working setup faster with fewer choices up front ([#10306](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10306))
