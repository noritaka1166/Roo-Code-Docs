# Roo Code 3.36 Release Notes (Combined)

Roo Code 3.36 introduces non-destructive context management, new debugging and UI controls, and a steady stream of reliability fixes and provider improvements.

<img src="/img/v3.36.0/v3.36.0.png" alt="Roo Code v3.36 Release" width="600" />

## Non-Destructive Context Management

Context condensing and sliding window truncation now preserve your original messages internally rather than deleting them ([#9665](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9665)). When you rewind to an earlier checkpoint, the full conversation history is restored automatically.

## GPT-5.1 Codex Max Support

Roo Code supports GPT-5.1 Codex Max, OpenAI’s long-horizon coding model, including model defaults for gpt-5.1 / gpt-5 / gpt-5-mini variants ([#9848](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9848)).

## Browser Screenshot Saving

The browser tool can now save screenshots to a specified file path with a new `screenshot` action, so you can capture visual state during browser automation tasks ([#9963](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9963)).

## Extra-High Reasoning Effort

If you use gpt-5.1-codex-max with the OpenAI provider, you can now select an “Extra High” reasoning effort level for maximum reasoning depth on complex tasks ([#9900](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9900)).

## OpenRouter Native Tools Default

OpenRouter models that support native tools now use native tool calling by default, improving tool calling reliability without manual configuration ([#9878](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9878)).

## Error Details Modal

Hover over error rows to reveal an info icon that opens a modal with full error details and a copy button ([#9985](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9985)).

## GPT-5.2 Model Support

GPT-5.2 is available in the OpenAI provider and set as the default model ([#10024](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10024)).

## Enter Key Behavior Toggle

You can now configure how Enter behaves in the chat input so it better fits multiline prompts and different input methods ([#10002](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10002)).

## Gemini 3 Flash preview model

The `gemini-3-flash-preview` model is now available in the Roo Code Cloud provider, Google Gemini, GCP Vertex AI, Requesty, and OpenRouter providers. It’s the latest model from Google, released this morning (thanks contributors!) ([#10151](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10151)).

## DeepSeek reasoner: interleaved thinking during tool use

The DeepSeek provider's `deepseek-reasoner` model now supports "interleaved thinking" and native tool calling. In our internal evals, tool calling succeeded 100% of the time, and the extended-run score improved to 93.4% (thanks zbww_!) ([#9969](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9969), [#10141](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10141)).

## Native Tool Protocol Default

Models that support native tool calling now default to using native protocol instead of XML. The XML protocol is still available in provider settings ([#10186](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10186)).

## Vertex AI: 1M context window for Claude Sonnet 4.5

When you use **Claude Sonnet 4.5** on **Vertex AI**, you can enable a **1M context window** option for supported models ([#10209](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10209)).

## Chat error troubleshooting improvements

Chat error states now make it easier to understand what went wrong and to share the right details when filing a bug report:

* **Clearer error visibility**: Error rows more consistently surface full error details (including status codes) via a more obvious **View details** affordance ([#10204](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10204))
* **Downloadable diagnostics**: You can generate a local diagnostics file from a chat error (including error metadata and the API conversation history) so you can review/redact and share it with an issue report ([#10188](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10188))

## QOL Improvements

* **Symlink support for slash commands**: Share and organize commands across projects using symlinks for individual files or directories, with command names derived from symlink names ([#9838](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9838))

* **Simplified Auto-Approve settings**: Removes separate toggles for retry and todo updates, reducing configuration overhead ([#10062](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10062))
* **Richer error details dialog**: Adds extra context (extension version, provider/model, timestamp, etc.) to the error details dialog to make debugging and reporting issues faster ([#10050](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10050))
* **Fewer read_file failures on large files**: Improves large-file reading by incrementally reading up to a token budget and returning cleaner truncation when needed ([#10052](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10052))
* **Improved File Editing with Gemini Models**: New edit_file tool makes Gemini models more effective at editing files ([#9983](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9983))
* **VS Code LM Native Tools**: Native tool calling now works with VS Code's built-in Copilot models ([#10191](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10191))
* **Smarter Tool Defaults for Gemini and OpenAI**: Gemini and OpenAI models now use better default tools for file editing, improving reliability out of the box. ([#10170](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10170))
* **Grace Retry for Tool Errors**: When models fail to use tools, Roo Code now silently retries before showing errors. Clearer "Model Response Incomplete" messages appear only after consecutive failures ([#10196](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10196))

## Bug Fixes
