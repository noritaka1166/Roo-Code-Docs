## Provider Updates

* **Model Default Temperatures**: Models can now specify their own default temperature settings. Temperature precedence is: user's custom setting → model's default → system default ([#9734](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9734))

* **Roo Provider Native Tools**: Models with the `default-native-tools` tag automatically use native tool calling by default for improved tool-based interactions ([#9735](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9735))

* **LiteLLM Native Tool Support**: All LiteLLM models now assume native tool support by default, improving tool compatibility and reducing configuration issues ([#9736](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9736))

* **App Version Tracking**: The Roo provider now sends app version information with API requests for improved request tracking and analytics ([#9730](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9730))
