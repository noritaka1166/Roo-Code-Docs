# Roo Code 3.35.0 Release Notes (2025-12-01)

This release introduces metadata-driven subtasks that never lose their parent connection, plus native tool calling support for 15+ providers.

## Metadata-Driven Subtasks

The connection between subtasks and parent tasks no longer breaks when you exit a task, crash, reboot, or reload VS Code ([#9090](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9090)). Subtask relationships are now controlled by metadata, so the parent-child link persists through any interruption.

## Native Tool Calling Expansion

Native tool calling support has been expanded to 15+ providers:

* Bedrock ([#9698](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9698))
* Cerebras ([#9692](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9692))
* Chutes ([#9715](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9715))
* DeepInfra ([#9691](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9691))
* DeepSeek & Doubao ([#9671](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9671))
* Groq ([#9673](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9673))
* LiteLLM ([#9719](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9719))
* Ollama ([#9696](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9696))
* OpenAI-compatible: Fireworks, SambaNova, Featherless, IO Intelligence ([#9676](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9676))
* Requesty ([#9672](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9672))
* Unbound ([#9699](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9699))
* Vercel AI Gateway ([#9697](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9697))
* Vertex Gemini ([#9678](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9678))
* xAI with new Grok 4 Fast models ([#9690](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9690))

## QOL Improvements

* **Improved Onboarding**: Simplified provider settings during initial setup—advanced options remain in Settings ([#9709](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9709))
* **Cleaner Toolbar**: Modes and MCP settings consolidated into the main settings panel for better discoverability ([#9710](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9710))
* **Tool Format in Environment Details**: Models now receive tool format information, improving behavior when switching between XML and native tools ([#9661](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9661))
* **Debug Buttons**: View API and UI history with new debug buttons (requires `roo-cline.debug: true`) ([#9684](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9684))
* **Grok Code Fast Default**: Native tools now default for xai/grok-code-fast-1 ([#9717](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9717))

## Bug Fixes

* **Parallel Tool Calls Fix**: Preserve tool_use blocks in summary during context condensation, fixing 400 errors with Anthropic's parallel tool calls feature (thanks SilentFlower!) ([#9714](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9714))
* **Navigation Button Wrapping**: Prevent navigation buttons from wrapping on smaller screens ([#9721](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9721))

## Misc Improvements

* **Model-specific Tool Customization**: Configure `excludedTools` and `includedTools` per model for fine-grained tool availability control ([#9641](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9641))
* **apply_patch Tool**: New native tool for file editing using simplified diff format with fuzzy matching and file rename support ([#9663](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9663))
* **search_and_replace Tool**: Batch text replacements with partial matching and error recovery ([#9549](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9549))
