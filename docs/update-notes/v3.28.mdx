# Roo Code 3.28 Combined Release Notes

This version introduces Task Sync & Roomote Control for monitoring and controlling tasks from your phone, plus Roo Code Cloud integration features, enhanced chat editing, conversation preservation improvements, and multiple bug fixes.

## Task Sync & Roomote Control

Introducing our new cloud connectivity features that let you **monitor and control long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync and Roomote Control are optional supplementary services that connect your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

- **Full Chat Control**: Interact with the chatbox as though you were in your IDE
- **Start/Stop Tasks**: Launch new tasks or terminate running ones from anywhere

## QOL Improvements

* **Click-to-Edit Chat Messages**: Click directly on any message text to edit it, with ESC to cancel and improved padding consistency ([#7790](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7790))
* **Enhanced Reasoning Display**: The AI's thinking process now shows a persistent timer and displays reasoning content in clean italic text ([#7752](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7752))
* **Manual Auth URL Input**: Users in containerized environments can now paste authentication redirect URLs manually when automatic redirection fails ([#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805))
* **Active Mode Centering**: The mode selector dropdown now automatically centers the active mode when opened ([#7883](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7883))
* **Preserve First Message**: The first message containing slash commands or initial context is now preserved during conversation condensing instead of being replaced with a summary ([#7910](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7910))
* **Checkpoint Initialization Notifications**: You'll now receive clear notifications when checkpoint initialization fails, particularly with nested Git repositories ([#7766](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7766))

* Smaller and more subtle auto-approve UI (thanks brunobergher!) ([#7894](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7894))
* Disable Roomote Control on logout for better security ([#7976](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7976))
* Add padding to the cloudview for better visual spacing ([#7954](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7954))

* Temporarily pause auto-approve with a global “Enabled” switch so you can pause without losing your per-toggle selections; the UI clearly distinguishes global vs. per-toggle states ([#8024](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8024))
* Slash commands management moved to Settings > Slash Commands with a gear shortcut from the chat popover; the popover is now selection-only for quick use ([#7988](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7988))
* Keyboard shortcut to quickly “Add to Context” (macOS: Cmd+Y; Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Y) ([#7908](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7908))
* Add Image button moved inside the text area (top-right) and Enhance Prompt positioned above Send to reduce pointer travel and clarify layout ([#7989](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7989))
* Composer action buttons now appear only when there’s text input, reducing visual clutter and accidental clicks ([#7987](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7987))
* New Task button icon switched from “+” to a compose/pencil icon to better match its purpose and align with codicon standards ([#7942](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7942))
## Bug Fixes

* **Groq Context Window**: Fixed incorrect display of cached tokens in context window ([#7839](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7839))
* **Chat Message Operations**: Resolved duplication issues when editing messages and "Couldn't find timestamp" errors when deleting ([#7793](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7793))
* **UI Overlap**: Fixed CodeBlock button z-index to prevent overlap with popovers and configuration panels (thanks A0nameless0man!) ([#7783](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7783))
* Fix message queue re-queue loop in Task.ask() that could degrade performance ([#7823](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7823))
* Restrict @-mention parsing to line-start or whitespace boundaries to prevent false triggers ([#7876](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7876))
* Make nested git repository warning persistent with path info for better visibility ([#7885](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7885))
* Include API key in Ollama /api/tags requests to support authenticated instances (thanks ItsOnlyBinary!) ([#7903](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7903))

* **Image Preview Caching**: This ensures the chat always displays the newly generated image instead of a cached version ([#7860](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7860))

* Restore square brackets in Gemini-generated code so arrays/indexers render correctly (e.g., `string[] items = new string[5];`) (thanks AtkinsDynamicObjects!) ([#7577](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7577))
* Filter out Claude Code built-in tools (ExitPlanMode, BashOutput, KillBash) to avoid erroneous tool calls and distracting warnings (thanks juliettefournier-econ!) ([#7818](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7818))
* Fix an issue where the context menu could be obscured while editing messages; the menu stays visible and usable across screen sizes (thanks NaccOll, mini2s!) ([#7951](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7951))
* Surface a clear, actionable error instead of cryptic ByteString conversion failures during code indexing when API keys contain invalid/special characters (thanks PavelA85!) ([#8008](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8008))
* Correct C# tree-sitter query so C# files are parsed and indexed properly, improving semantic search, navigation, and context quality (thanks mubeen-zulfiqar, vadash, Source-GuyCoder!) ([#7813](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7813))
