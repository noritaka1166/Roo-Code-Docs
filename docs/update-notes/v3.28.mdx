# Roo Code 3.28 Combined Release Notes

This version introduces the Supernova model to Roo Code Cloud, Task Sync for monitoring tasks from your phone, plus Roo Code Cloud integration features, enhanced chat editing, conversation preservation improvements, and multiple bug fixes.

## Supernova Model - FREE Access

We've added the new **roo/code-supernova** stealth model to the Roo Code Cloud provider - **completely FREE during the promotional period** ([#8175](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8175)):

- **FREE ACCESS**: No API keys, no costs - completely free through Roo Code Cloud
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Powerful AI model with **image support** for multimodal coding tasks
- **Not So Massive Context**: 200,000 token context window with 16,384 max output
- **Stealth Performance**: Experience cutting-edge model performance with the code-supernova variant
- **Zero Setup**: Just select it from your Roo Code Cloud provider - no configuration needed

Select the **FREE** code-supernova model from the Roo provider to start using this powerful new capability at **no cost**.

> **Documentation**: See the [Roo Code Router guide](/providers/roo-code-router) for model selection details.

## Task Sync

Introducing our new cloud connectivity feature that lets you **monitor long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync is an optional supplementary service that connects your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

**[Task Sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync) (FREE for All Users)**:
- **Monitor from Anywhere**: Check on long-running tasks from your phone while away from your desk
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of your local task messages and progress
- **Task History**: Your tasks are saved to the cloud for later reference
- **Cloud Visibility**: View your VS Code tasks from any browser

> **Documentation**: See [Task Sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync).

## GPT-5-Codex lands in OpenAI Native

- **Work with repository-scale context**: Keep multi-file specs and long reviews in a single thread thanks to a 400k token window.
- **Reuse prompts faster and include visuals**: Prompt caching and image support help you iterate on UI fixes without re-uploading context.
- **Let the model adapt its effort**: GPT-5-Codex automatically balances quick responses for simple questions with deeper reasoning on complex builds.

This gives teams a higher-capacity OpenAI option without extra configuration.[#8260](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8260):

> **Documentation**: See [OpenAI Provider Guide](/providers/openai) for capabilities and setup guidance.

* **Preserve First Message**: The first message containing slash commands or initial context is now preserved during conversation condensing instead of being replaced with a summary ([#7910](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7910))
* **Checkpoint Initialization Notifications**: You'll now receive clear notifications when checkpoint initialization fails, particularly with nested Git repositories ([#7766](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7766))
* **Translation coverage auditing**: The translation checker now validates package.nls locales by default to catch missing strings before release (via [#8255](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8255))

* Smaller and more subtle auto-approve UI (thanks brunobergher!) ([#7894](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7894))
* Add padding to the cloudview for better visual spacing ([#7954](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7954))

* **Network Resilience**: Telemetry data now automatically retries on network failures, ensuring analytics and diagnostics aren't lost during connectivity issues ([#7597](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7597))
* **Code blocks wrap by default**: Code blocks now wrap text by default, and the snippet toolbar no longer includes language or wrap toggles, keeping snippets readable across locales (via [#8194](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8194); [#8208](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8208))

* **Reset logs you out of Roo Code Cloud**: Reset now also logs you out of Roo Code Cloud for a truly clean slate; the reset still completes even if logout fails. ([#8312](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8312))
* **Measure engagement with upsell messages**: Telemetry for DismissibleUpsell tracks dismiss vs click (upsellId only) to tune messaging and reduce noise; no user-facing behavior change. ([#8309](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8309))
* **Welcome screen Roo provider experiment**: Surfaces the Roo provider on the welcome screen (localized, with click telemetry) to speed up setup. ([#8317](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8317))
* **Cleaner prompts (no “thinking” tags)**: Removes `<thinking>` tags for cleaner output, fewer tokens, and better model compatibility; preserves the plain‑language rule to confirm tool success. ([#8319](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8319))
* **Simpler Requesty model refresh**: Removes an unnecessary warning when refreshing the Requesty models list so you can fetch new policies without leaving the screen. ([#7710](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7710))
* **Bedrock 1M Context Checkbox**: Adds checkbox to enable 1M context window support for Claude Sonnet 4 and 4.5 on Bedrock, providing more flexibility for large-scale projects ([#8384](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8384))
* Include reasoning messages in cloud task histories so you can review complete thinking after runs ([#8401](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8401))

* Identify Cloud tasks in the extension bridge to improve diagnostics, logging, and future UI behavior ([#8539](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8539))
* Add the parent task ID in telemetry to improve traceability ([#8532](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8532))
* Clarify the zh‑TW “Run command” label to match the tooltip and reduce confusion (thanks PeterDaveHello!) ([#8631](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8631))
