# Roo Code 3.36.7 Release Notes (2025-12-15)

This release simplifies Auto-Approve settings, improves OpenRouter behavior for OpenAI models, and expands Amazon Bedrock options.

## OpenRouter tool support for OpenAI models

When you use **OpenAI models via OpenRouter**, Roo now makes tool usage more predictable by explicitly enabling `apply_patch` and avoiding file-writing tools that aren’t supported in that context ([#10082](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10082)).

This reduces friction when tool availability differs between providers/models and helps keep edits moving without unexpected interruptions.

## Simplified Auto-Approve settings

Auto-Approve no longer has separate toggles for **Retry failed requests** and **Update todo list**—when Auto-Approve is enabled, retries and todo updates run automatically ([#10062](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10062)).

If you relied on those individual switches, this reduces configuration overhead and makes the Auto-Approve behavior easier to understand.

## Bug Fixes

* **More consistent tool validation for modes**: Improves reliability by consolidating mode tool-availability checks in one place ([#10089](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10089))

## Provider Updates

* **More detailed OpenRouter error reporting**: Captures more provider-specific error metadata so failures are easier to diagnose ([#10073](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10073))
* **AWS Bedrock service tier support**: Adds a Bedrock **Service tier** option (Standard/Flex/Priority) for supported models (thanks Smartsheet-JB-Brown!) ([#9955](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9955))
* **Amazon Nova 2 Lite in Bedrock**: Adds the Nova 2 Lite model to the Bedrock provider model list (thanks Smartsheet-JB-Brown!) ([#9830](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9830))

## Misc Improvements

* **Improved web-evals run logs**: Makes evaluation runs easier to inspect by improving run logs and formatting ([#10081](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10081))
