# Roo Code 3.35.3 Release Notes (2025-12-02)

This release improves the onboarding experience with a simplified welcome view and adds stealth model support for API providers.

## QOL Improvements

* **New Welcome View**: Simplified welcome view with consolidated components for a cleaner, more consistent onboarding experience ([#9741](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9741))

## Misc Improvements

* **Stealth Model Privacy**: Models tagged with "stealth" in the Roo API now receive vendor confidentiality instructions in their system prompt, enabling white-label or anonymous model experiences ([#9742](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9742))
