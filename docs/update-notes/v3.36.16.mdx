# Roo Code 3.36.16 Release Notes (2025-12-19)

This release fixes a VS Code LM provider issue that could fail with an HTTP 400 error when using native tool calling.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where using the VS Code LM provider (GitHub Copilot) could fail with an HTTP 400 error when Roo attempted native tool calling, by normalizing tool input schemas to the format Copilot expects ([#10221](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10221))
