# Roo Code 3.32 Release Notes (2025-11-14)

Roo Code 3.32 combines GPT-5.1 model support and OpenAI Responses prompt caching with reliability fixes for OpenAI Native and native tool protocol.

## GPT-5.1 models and OpenAI prompt caching

* **GPT-5.1 in Roo Code** ([#9252](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9252), [#9258](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9258), [#9261](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9261), [#9259](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9259))  
  Adds the new GPT-5.1 models across supported providers, with extended 24‑hour prompt caching support in the OpenAI Native provider and improved overall software‑engineering performance.

## Bug Fixes

* **Share button works reliably again** ([#9253](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9253))  
  Fixes the Share button so you can open the share popover and send shared tasks and messages without failures.

* **Keep OpenAI Native reasoning stable during condensing** ([#9263](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9263))  
  Keeps encrypted reasoning blocks paired with the assistant messages that produced them so OpenAI Native condensing no longer throws errors and long-running tasks with reasoning stay stable even as history is trimmed.

* **Prevent duplicate tool_result blocks for read_file in native protocol** ([#9272](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9272))  
  Ensures read_file emits exactly one tool_result per tool_call_id in native protocol, preventing 400 errors while still surfacing clear error messages to both the agent and the user.

* **Fix duplicate tool blocks causing "tool has already been used" errors** ([#9275](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9275))  
  Stops XML protocol runs from merging duplicate tool blocks into assistant messages so each tool block executes only once per turn and tool-driven tasks no longer get stuck behind false “tool has already been used” errors.

* **Make OpenAI Native cancellation stop streaming immediately** ([#9276](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9276))  
  Adds an abort controller so cancelling an OpenAI Native request stops streaming promptly, avoiding extra tokens after cancellation and reducing wasted usage.

* **Disable XML parser for native tool protocol** ([#9277](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9277))  
  Bypasses XML parsing when toolProtocol is set to native and relies on structured tool_call chunks instead, avoiding mis-parsed XML-like snippets and making native tool runs more reliable—especially for models that sometimes mix formats.
