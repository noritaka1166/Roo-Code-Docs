# Roo Code 3.35 Release Notes (Combined)

This release introduces metadata-driven subtasks that never lose their parent connection, plus native tool calling support for 15+ providers.

## Metadata-Driven Subtasks

The connection between subtasks and parent tasks no longer breaks when you exit a task, crash, reboot, or reload VS Code ([#9090](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9090)). Subtask relationships are now controlled by metadata, so the parent-child link persists through any interruption.

## Native Tool Calling Expansion

Native tool calling support has been expanded to 15+ providers:

* Bedrock ([#9698](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9698))
* Cerebras ([#9692](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9692))
* Chutes ([#9715](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9715))
* DeepInfra ([#9691](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9691))
* DeepSeek & Doubao ([#9671](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9671))
* Groq ([#9673](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9673))
* LiteLLM ([#9719](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9719))
* Ollama ([#9696](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9696))
* OpenAI-compatible: Fireworks, SambaNova, Featherless, IO Intelligence ([#9676](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9676))
* Requesty ([#9672](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9672))
* Unbound ([#9699](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9699))
* Vercel AI Gateway ([#9697](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9697))
* Vertex Gemini ([#9678](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9678))
* xAI with new Grok 4 Fast models ([#9690](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9690))

## QOL Improvements

* **Improved Onboarding**: Simplified provider settings during initial setup—advanced options remain in Settings ([#9709](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9709))
* **Cleaner Toolbar**: Modes and MCP settings consolidated into the main settings panel for better discoverability ([#9710](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9710))
* **Tool Format in Environment Details**: Models now receive tool format information, improving behavior when switching between XML and native tools ([#9661](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9661))
* **Debug Buttons**: View API and UI history with new debug buttons (requires `roo-cline.debug: true`) ([#9684](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9684))
* **Grok Code Fast Default**: Native tools now default for xai/grok-code-fast-1 ([#9717](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9717))
* **New Welcome View**: Simplified welcome view with consolidated components for a cleaner, more consistent onboarding experience ([#9741](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9741))
* **Simplified write_to_file Tool**: The `line_count` parameter has been removed from the write_to_file tool, making tool calls cleaner and reducing potential errors from incorrect line counts ([#9667](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9667))
* **OpenRouter Embeddings Provider Routing**: Select specific routing providers for OpenRouter embeddings in code indexing settings, enabling cost optimization since providers can vary by 4-5x in price for the same embedding model (thanks SannidhyaSah!) ([#9693](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9693))
* **CloudView Interface Updates**: Cleaner UI with refreshed marketing copy, updated button styling with rounded corners for a more modern look ([#9776](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9776))

## Bug Fixes

* **Parallel Tool Calls Fix**: Preserve tool_use blocks in summary during context condensation, fixing 400 errors with Anthropic's parallel tool calls feature (thanks SilentFlower!) ([#9714](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9714))
* **Navigation Button Wrapping**: Prevent navigation buttons from wrapping on smaller screens ([#9721](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9721))
* **Task Delegation Tool Flush**: Fixes 400 errors that occurred when using native tool protocol with parallel tool calls (e.g., `update_todo_list` + `new_task`). Pending tool results are now properly flushed before task delegation ([#9726](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9726))
* **Malformed Tool Call Fix**: Fixed a regression where malformed native tool calls would cause Roo Code to hang indefinitely. Tool calls now proceed to validation which catches and reports the missing parameters properly ([#9758](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9758))

## Misc Improvements

* **Model-specific Tool Customization**: Configure `excludedTools` and `includedTools` per model for fine-grained tool availability control ([#9641](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9641))
* **apply_patch Tool**: New native tool for file editing using simplified diff format with fuzzy matching and file rename support ([#9663](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9663))
* **search_and_replace Tool**: Batch text replacements with partial matching and error recovery ([#9549](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9549))
* **Better IPC Error Logging**: Error logs now display detailed structured data instead of unhelpful `[object Object]` messages, making debugging extension issues easier ([#9727](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9727))
* **Stealth Model Privacy**: Models tagged with "stealth" in the Roo API now receive vendor confidentiality instructions in their system prompt, enabling white-label or anonymous model experiences ([#9742](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9742))

## Provider Updates

* **Model Default Temperatures**: Models can now specify their own default temperature settings. Temperature precedence is: user's custom setting → model's default → system default ([#9734](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9734))
* **Roo Provider Native Tools**: Models with the `default-native-tools` tag automatically use native tool calling by default ([#9735](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9735))
* **LiteLLM Native Tool Support**: All LiteLLM models now assume native tool support by default, improving tool compatibility ([#9736](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9736))
* **App Version Tracking**: The Roo provider now sends app version information with API requests for improved request tracking ([#9730](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9730))
* **z.ai GLM Model Fix**: Removed misleading reasoning toggle UI for GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.6 models on z.ai provider, as these models don't support think/reasoning data for coding agents ([#9752](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9752))
* **Roo Provider Tool Compatibility**: Improved tool conversion for OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, ensuring tools work correctly with OpenAI-style request formats ([#9769](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9769))
* **MiniMax M2 Free Tier Default**: MiniMax M2 model now defaults to the free tier when using OpenRouter ([#9778](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9778))
