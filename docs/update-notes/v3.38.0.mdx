# Roo Code 3.38.0 Release Notes (2025-12-27)

This release adds Agent Skills, improves slash command behavior, and streamlines providers and file reading.

## Agent Skills

Roo now supports Agent Skills, which are portable skill folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that the agent can discover and load on demand. This lets you package repeatable workflows and domain knowledge once and reuse them across projects to make results more consistent and reliable. ([#10335](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10335)):

> **📚 Documentation**: See [Skills](/features/skills) for setup and usage.

## QOL Improvements

* Slash commands can declare a target mode in their front matter, so triggering a command can switch Roo to the right mode first ([#10344](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10344)).
* Removes the legacy “simple read file” tool path so file reading consistently uses the standard `read_file` tool ([#10254](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10254)).

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where some Claude Sonnet 4.5 requests could fail with HTTP 400 errors after context condensing ([#10359](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10359)).

## Misc Improvements

* Custom tools can import npm packages, and can load secrets from a same-folder `.env` file ([#10336](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10336)).

## Provider Updates

* Removes the “OpenRouter Transforms” setting and stops sending the `transforms` parameter on OpenRouter requests ([#10341](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10341)).
