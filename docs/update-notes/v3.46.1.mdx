# Roo Code 3.46.1 Release Notes (2026-01-31)

This release streamlines Skills setup and first-run onboarding, and improves tool-call reliability.

## QOL Improvements

* **Import settings during first-run setup**: You can import a settings file directly from the welcome screen on a fresh install, before configuring a provider. (thanks emeraldcheshire!) ([#10994](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10994))
* **Change a skill’s mode from the Skills UI**: You can set which mode a skill targets (including “Any mode”) using a dropdown, instead of moving files between mode folders manually. (thanks SannidhyaSah!) ([#11102](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11102))

## Bug Fixes

* **More reliable tool-call history**: Fixes an issue where mismatched `tool_use`/`tool_result` IDs in conversation history could break tool execution with `ToolResultIdMismatchError`. ([#11131](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11131))

## Misc Improvements

* **Quieter startup when no `.env` file is present**: Avoids noisy `[MISSING_ENV_FILE]` console output when the optional `.env` file isn’t used. ([#11116](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11116))
