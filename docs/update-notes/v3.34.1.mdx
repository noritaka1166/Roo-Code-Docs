# Roo Code 3.34.1 Release Notes (2025-11-23)

This patch release lets evaluation jobs run on Roo Code Cloud models, makes image generation prompts easier to read, cleans up todo list updates, and prevents duplicate cloud-synced messages.

## Bug Fixes

* **Single todo list in updates**: Removed a redundant todo list block from chat updates so you only see one clean, focused list when the updateTodoList tool runs ([#9517](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9517), [#9522](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9522)).
* **Cloud message deduplication**: Fixed cloud message syncing so duplicate copies of the same reasoning or assistant message are no longer re-synced, keeping task histories cleaner and less confusing ([#9518](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9518), [#9522](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9522)).

## QOL Improvements

* **Clearer image generation prompts**: The full prompt and path for image generation now appear directly in the chat UI with clearer spacing and typography, making it easier to inspect, debug, and reuse prompts ([#9505](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9505), [#9522](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9522)).
* **Eval jobs on Roo Code Cloud**: You can now run evaluation jobs directly on Roo Code Cloud models, reusing the same managed models and job tokens as regular cloud runs ([#9492](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9492), [#9522](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9522)).
