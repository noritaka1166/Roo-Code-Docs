## OpenAI Codex provider with OAuth subscription access

Adds the OpenAI Codex provider with subscription-based OAuth sign-in, so you can connect a ChatGPT Plus/Pro account to use Codex models without API keys or per-token billing. Just select `OpenAI - ChatGPT Plus/Pro` in the provider settings! ([#10736](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10736))

## GPT-5.2-Codex model option for OpenAI (Native)

Adds the GPT-5.2-Codex model to the OpenAI (Native) provider so you can select the coding-optimized model with its expanded context window and reasoning effort controls. ([#10731](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10731))

## Bug Fixes

* **Gemini sessions no longer fail after a provider switch**: Resolves a streaming error where LiteLLM Gemini tool calls could fail with corrupted thought signatures when switching models mid-task. ([#10743](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10743))
* **Long terminal runs no longer degrade memory**: Fixes a memory leak where large command outputs could keep growing buffers after completion, leading to gray screens during long sessions. ([#7666](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7666))

## Misc Improvements

* **End-to-end tests run reliably again**: Restores MCP and subtask coverage and fixes flaky tool tests so contributors can run CI-like checks locally and catch regressions earlier. (thanks ArchimedesCrypto, dcbartlett!) ([#10720](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10720))
* **Automated tests no longer stall on tool approvals**: Fixes a problem where MCP end-to-end tests could hang on manual approval prompts by auto-approving time server tools. (thanks ArchimedesCrypto!) ([#10733](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10733))
