## Roo Code Router rename

Roo Code now shows **Roo Code Router** anywhere the extension previously referred to the **Roo Code Cloud Provider**. The new name is meant to make the intent clearer: Roo Code Router is a router-style provider (similar in idea to other router/aggregator services), but with a **curated set of models we’ve tested with Roo Code**. ([#10560](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10560)).

## QOL Improvements

* **Roo Code Router naming consistency**: Updates the Roo Code Router service name and link so the UI points at the correct destination ([#10607](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10607))
* **Roo Code Router naming consistency**: Updates router naming in shared types so labels stay consistent across the UI ([#10605](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10605))
* **ExtensionHost organization**: Improves internal organization around mode changes and related events to help keep behavior consistent ([#10600](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10600))
* **CLI release testing**: Adds options to build and install the CLI release locally for testing ([#10597](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10597))
* **CLI organization**: Reorganizes the CLI file structure to make future changes easier to maintain ([#10599](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10599))

## Misc Improvements

* **CLI TUI**: Adds an interactive terminal UI mode to the Roo CLI ([#10480](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10480))
