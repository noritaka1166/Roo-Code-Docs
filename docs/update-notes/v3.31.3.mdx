## Bug Fixes

* OpenAI native encrypted reasoning parameters: Restores usability of gpt-5-chat-latest by including encrypted reasoning only when a reasoning effort is set and enforcing medium-only verbosity to prevent invalid parameter errors (thanks politsin!) ([#9231](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9231))
* Roo Anthropic token normalization: Prevents double-counting cached tokens so usage metrics, cost estimates, and context calculations are accurate across providers ([#9224](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9224))

## Misc Improvements

* Terminology cleanup for context handling: Rename "sliding window" to "context management" and unify the code path under a single entry point, manageContext, for clearer behavior and documentation alignment ([#9206](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9206))
