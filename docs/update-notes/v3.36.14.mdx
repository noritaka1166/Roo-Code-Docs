## Provider Updates

* **Native Tool Calling for Claude on Vertex AI**: All Claude models on Vertex AI now use native tool calling by default, matching the behavior of direct Anthropic API access ([#10197](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10197))

## QOL Improvements

* **Grace Retry for Tool Errors**: When models fail to use tools, Roo Code now silently retries before showing errors. Clearer "Model Response Incomplete" messages appear only after consecutive failures ([#10196](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10196))

## Bug Fixes

* **MCP Compatibility with OpenAI Providers**: Fixes an issue where MCP servers using `format: "uri"` in their tool schemas would fail with OpenAI providers ([#10198](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10198))
