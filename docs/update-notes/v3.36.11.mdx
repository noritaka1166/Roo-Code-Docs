## Native Tool Calling Enhancements

Native tool calling is now enabled by default for three additional providers: Claude Code, Z.ai models (GLM-4.5 series, GLM-4.6, etc.), and OpenAI Compatible providers. This provides more direct and efficient communication with these models, improving reliability and performance when using tools ([#10077](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10077), [#10158](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10158), [#10159](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10159)).

## Bug Fixes

* **MCP Tool Schema Normalization**: Fixes an issue where MCP tool schemas could fail validation when used with Amazon Bedrock or OpenAI in strict mode by normalizing JSON Schema formats ([#10148](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10148))
* **MCP Tool Names with Bedrock**: Fixes validation errors when using MCP servers with dots or colons in their names (like `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server`) with Amazon Bedrock ([#10152](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10152))
* **Bedrock Task Resumption**: Fixes an error when resuming tasks with Amazon Bedrock when native tools are disabled, where users would encounter `The toolConfig field must be defined` errors ([#10155](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10155))
* **Roo Code Cloud Model Refresh**: Fixes an issue where authentication-required models (like `google/gemini-3-flash`) wouldn't appear immediately after logging into Roo Code Cloud ([#10156](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10156))
* **AWS GovCloud and China Region Support**: Fixes an issue where users in AWS GovCloud and China regions couldn't use custom ARNs with the Bedrock provider (thanks wisestmumbler!) ([#10157](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10157))
