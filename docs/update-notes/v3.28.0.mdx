# Roo Code 3.28.0 Release Notes (2025-09-10)

This release introduces Task Sync - check on long-running tasks from your phone without being stuck at your desk. Plus enhanced chat editing and multiple bug fixes.

## Task Sync

Introducing our new cloud connectivity feature that lets you **monitor long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync is an optional supplementary service that connects your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

- **Monitor from Anywhere**: Check on long-running tasks from your phone while away from your desk
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of your local task messages and progress
- **Task History**: Your tasks are saved to the cloud for later reference
- **Cloud Visibility**: View your VS Code tasks from any browser
