# Roo Code 3.39.1 Release Notes (2026-01-08)

This patch release improves native tool-call reliability and fixes task resume issues for Gemini.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where file paths shown during native tool-call streaming could appear incorrect or truncated, making it harder to confirm which file Roo is reading or editing ([#10555](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10555)).
* Fixes an issue where resuming a task with Gemini models that use extended thinking could fail with a “Corrupted thought signature” / INVALID_ARGUMENT error ([#10554](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10554)).
* Fixes an issue where `ask_followup_question` could fail with some Anthropic-backed setups due to strict tool schema validation ([#10551](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10551)).
