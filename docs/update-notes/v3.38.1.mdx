# Roo Code 3.38.1 Release Notes (2025-12-29)

This patch release improves reliability when using tools and context condensing, refines tool error messages, and fixes a few small UI/link issues.

## QOL Improvements

* Clarifies the navigation path for deleting a Roo Code Cloud account in the privacy policy, so you can find Security Settings faster ([#10367](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10367))
* Improves internal analytics consistency by recording custom tools the same way as MCP tools, which helps tool usage and error tracking stay accurate ([#10364](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10364))

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where manually condensing context while a tool is still running could trigger provider protocol errors, so tool runs and manual condenses can safely overlap ([#10379](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10379))
* Reverts a change for OpenAI-compatible providers to avoid message-format regressions related to text appearing after tool results ([#10381](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10381))
* Enforces the `maxConcurrentFileReads` limit for `read_file`, returning a clear error instead of silently ignoring the setting ([#10363](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10363))
* Improves the error shown when `read_file` is run on a directory by explicitly explaining the issue and suggesting `list_files` instead ([#10371](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10371))
* Fixes an issue where the "open source" link on roocode.com could point to a non-existent GitHub organization, so it reliably opens the correct repository (thanks jishnuteegala!) ([#10377](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10377))
