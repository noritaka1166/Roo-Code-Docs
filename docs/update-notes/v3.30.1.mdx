# Roo Code 3.30.1 Release Notes (2025-11-04)

This patch improves reliability by fixing an embedding dimension mismatch and restoring stable cancel/resume behavior.


## Bug Fixes

* Correct OpenRouter Mistral embedding dimension to 1536 to prevent vector size errors; existing Qdrant collections are recreated with the correct size for consistent similarity search ([#9028](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9028))
* Revert recent cancel/resume change that caused UI flicker and unreliable resumption, restoring the previous stable behavior while a safer fix is prepared ([#9032](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9032))
