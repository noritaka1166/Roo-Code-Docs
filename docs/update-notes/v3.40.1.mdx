# Roo Code 3.40.1 Release Notes (2026-01-14)

This release fixes a mode-switching error when using Gemini.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where switching modes (e.g., from Code to Architect) while using Gemini would cause API errors due to tool permission conflicts in the conversation history. ([#10708](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10708))
