# Roo Code 3.35.4 Release Notes (2025-12-02)

This release fixes a tool call handling regression, simplifies the write_to_file tool, and corrects z.ai provider UI.

## QOL Improvements

* **Simplified write_to_file Tool**: The `line_count` parameter has been removed from the write_to_file tool, making tool calls cleaner and reducing potential errors from incorrect line counts ([#9667](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9667))

## Bug Fixes

* **Malformed Tool Call Fix**: Fixed a regression where malformed native tool calls would cause Roo Code to hang indefinitely. Tool calls now proceed to validation which catches and reports the missing parameters properly ([#9758](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9758))

## Provider Updates

* **z.ai GLM Model Fix**: Removed misleading reasoning toggle UI for GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.6 models on z.ai provider, as these models don't support think/reasoning data for coding agents ([#9752](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9752))
