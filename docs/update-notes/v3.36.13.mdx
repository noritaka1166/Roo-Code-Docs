## Native Tool Protocol Default

Models that support native tool calling now default to using native protocol instead of XML. The XML protocol is still available in provider settings ([#10186](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10186)).

## QOL Improvements

* **Improved File Editing with Gemini Models**: New edit_file tool makes Gemini models more effective at editing files ([#9983](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9983))
* **VS Code LM Native Tools**: Native tool calling now works with VS Code's built-in Copilot models ([#10191](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10191))

## Bug Fixes

* **LiteLLM Tool Protocol Dropdown**: The Native/XML protocol selector now appears correctly for LiteLLM models ([#10187](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10187))
* **Task Resumption**: Tasks no longer break when resuming after changing the Native Tool Calling setting ([#10192](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10192))

## Misc Improvements

* **Error Monitoring**: Improved tracking of consecutive mistake errors ([#10193](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10193))
