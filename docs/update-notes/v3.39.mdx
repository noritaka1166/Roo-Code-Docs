# Roo Code 3.39 Release Notes (Combined)

Roo Code 3.39 includes task-level provider profile persistence, improved multimodal workflows, new provider/model options, and reliability fixes across tool calling.

## Features

* **Task-level API configuration profiles**: Roo can persist the selected provider profile per task so follow-up sessions keep using the same provider/model settings.
* **Image file @mentions**: You can mention images in your workspace to give the model visual context directly from chat.
* **Headless Roo Code (CLI + VS Code shim)**: Run Roo Code in a headless environment with a basic CLI, plus an installer and an option to use the CLI for evals.
* **Debug proxy routing**: Adds debug-mode proxy routing to help troubleshoot API calls.

## QOL Improvements

* **BRRR naming update**: Renames YOLO to BRRR.
* **Smarter file @mention search**: Filters file @mention results using `.rooignore`.
* **Better tooling docs**: Improves the native `read_file` tool description and examples.
* **Web evals usability**: Remembers your last model selection in web evals and adds an evals skill.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes PowerShell ENOENT issues on Windows.
* Fixes shell-aware command chaining examples for Windows.
* Fixes tool-result preservation/deduplication issues that could lead to API errors.
* Fixes issues around tool protocol UI and provider configuration details.

## Provider Updates

* Adds new/updated models across multiple providers (e.g., Fireworks AI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Cerebras).
