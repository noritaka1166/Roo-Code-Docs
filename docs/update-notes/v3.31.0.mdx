This release refines task and to-do workflows, improves Roo Code Cloud diagnostics, tightens OpenRouter routing, and delivers key stability fixes for long-running sessions.

## Integrated task header and to-do list

The task header and to-do list now work together so you can see progress at a glance without juggling extra UI:

- Integrated to-dos directly into the task header so active work is always visible.
- Show only relevant to-do changes in chat instead of noisy full-list updates.
- Simplified header layout to reduce distractions while keeping key controls in reach.


## QOL Improvements

- **Less caffeinated welcome animation** ([#9104](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9104)): Smooths the Roo hover animation to be less distracting during long sessions while keeping the interface responsive.

## Bug Fixes

- **Respect custom OpenRouter-compatible URLs everywhere** ([#8951](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8951)): Ensures all OpenRouter-related operations (model lists, pricing, image generation, CSP checks) consistently use your configured custom base URL for better privacy, compliance, and predictable billing (thanks sstraus!).
- **Prevent crashes from null streaming chunks** ([#9105](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9105)): Handles provider responses with null choices arrays correctly, improving stability for long-running generations across MiniMax M2 Stable and other OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

- **Stop unwanted context condensing on settings save** ([#9108](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9108)): Saving settings no longer triggers early context condensing when your provider/model is unchanged, so active tasks retain history until thresholds are truly reached. (Contributors: daniel-lxs, hannesrudolph)

## Misc Improvements

- Improved Roo Code Cloud error logging to capture richer context (status codes, response bodies, and request details), making it easier to understand and resolve provider and configuration issues. ([#9098](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9098))
