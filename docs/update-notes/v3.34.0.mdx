## Browser Use 2.0
 
Browser Use now supports a more capable "2.0" experience ([#8941](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8941)):
 
- **Richer browser interaction**: Enables more advanced navigation and interaction patterns so Roo can better follow multi-step web workflows.
- **More reliable automation**: Improves stability for sequences of clicks, typing, and scrolling, reducing the chance of flaky browser runs.
- **Better fit for complex sites**: Makes it easier to work with modern web apps that require multiple steps or stateful interactions.
 
> **📚 Documentation**: See [Browser Use](/features/browser-use) for details on how to enable and use browser workflows. Note: We have not yet updated these docs with images and a video of the new experience.
 
## QOL Improvements
 
- **Provider-Oriented Welcome Screen**: Added a provider-focused welcome screen so new users can more quickly choose and configure a working model setup ([#9484](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9484)).
- **Pinned Roo Provider**: Pinned the Roo provider to the top of the provider list so it is easier to discover and select ([#9485](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9485)).
- **Clearer Native Tool Descriptions**: Enhanced built-in tool descriptions with examples and clarifications so Roo can choose the right tools and use them more accurately ([#9486](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9486)).
 
## Bug Fixes
 
- **Streaming Cancel Responsiveness**: Fixed the cancel button so it responds immediately during streaming, making it easier to stop long or unwanted runs (thanks jwadow!) ([#9448](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9448)).
- **apply_diff Performance Regression**: Resolved a recent performance regression in `apply_diff`, restoring fast patch application on larger edits ([#9474](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9474)).
- **Model Cache Refresh**: Implemented cache refreshing to avoid using stale disk-cached models, ensuring configuration updates are picked up correctly ([#9478](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9478)).
- **Tool Call Fallbacks**: Added a fallback to always yield tool calls regardless of `finish_reason`, preventing cases where valid tool calls were dropped ([#9476](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9476)).
 
## Provider Updates
 
- **Baseten Provider**: Added Baseten as a new AI provider, giving you another option for hosted models and deployments (thanks AlexKer!) ([#9461](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9461)).
- **OpenAI-Compatible Improvements**: Improved the base OpenAI-compatible provider configuration and error handling so more OpenAI-style endpoints work smoothly without special tweaks ([#9462](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9462)).
- **OpenRouter Capabilities**: Improved copying of model-level capabilities onto OpenRouter endpoint models so routing respects each model's real abilities ([#9483](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9483)).
