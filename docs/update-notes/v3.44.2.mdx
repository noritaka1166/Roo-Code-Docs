# Roo Code 3.44.2 Release Notes (2026-01-27)

This patch re-enables the “Parallel tool calls” experiment and fixes worktree indexing and provider tool-calling issues.

## Parallel tool calls (Experimental)

Re-enables parallel tool calling (with new_task isolation safeguards) so you can use the experimental “Parallel tool calls” setting again without breaking task delegation workflows. ([#11006](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11006))

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where Roo could fail to index code in worktrees stored inside hidden directories (for example `~/.roo/worktrees/`), which could break search and other codebase features in those worktrees. ([#11009](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11009))

## Provider Updates

* Fixes an issue where local Ollama models could be incorrectly flagged as unavailable due to validation running against an empty router model list. ([#10893](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10893))
* Fixes an issue where tools could appear twice when using OpenAI Responses API-based providers, reducing duplicate tool output and making results easier to follow. ([#11008](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11008))
