# Roo Code 3.46.2 Release Notes (2026-02-03)

This release improves message queuing and task cancellation, fixes MCP image tool outputs, and updates several providers.

## Bug Fixes

* **MCP tool results can include images**: Fixes an issue where MCP tools that return images (for example, Figma screenshots) could show up as “(No response)”. See [Using MCP in Roo](/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-roo) for details. (thanks Sniper199999!) ([#10874](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10874))
* **More reliable condensing with Bedrock via LiteLLM**: Fixes an issue where conversation condensing could fail when the history contained tool-use/tool-result blocks. ([#10975](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10975))
* **Messages aren’t dropped during command execution**: Fixes an issue where messages sent while a command was still running could be lost; they’re now queued and delivered when the command finishes. ([#11140](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11140))
* **OpenRouter model list refresh respects your Base URL**: Fixes an issue where refreshing the OpenRouter model list ignored a configured Base URL and always called openrouter.ai. See [OpenRouter](/providers/openrouter) for details. (thanks sebastianlang84!) ([#11154](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11154))
* **More reliable task cancellation and queued-message handling**: Fixes issues where canceling/closing tasks or updating queued messages could behave inconsistently between the VS Code extension and the CLI. ([#11162](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11162))

## Misc Improvements

* **Cleaner GitHub issue templates**: Removes the “Feature Request” option from the issue template chooser so feature requests are directed to Discussions. ([#11141](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11141))

## Provider Updates

* **Code indexing embedding model migration (Gemini)**: Keeps code indexing working by migrating requests from the deprecated `text-embedding-004` to `gemini-embedding-001`. See [Gemini](/providers/gemini) and [Codebase Indexing](/features/codebase-indexing). ([#11038](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11038))
* **Mistral provider migration to AI SDK**: Improves consistency for streaming and tool handling while preserving Codestral support and custom base URLs. See [Mistral](/providers/mistral). ([#11089](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11089))
* **SambaNova provider migration to AI SDK**: Improves streaming, tool-call handling, and usage reporting. See [SambaNova](/providers/sambanova). ([#11153](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11153))
* **xAI provider migration to the dedicated AI SDK package**: Improves consistency for streaming, tool calls, and usage reporting when using Grok models. See [xAI](/providers/xai). ([#11158](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/11158))
