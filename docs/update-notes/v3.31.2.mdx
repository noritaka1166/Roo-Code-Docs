# Roo Code 3.31.2 Release Notes (2025-11-13)

This patch improves stateless conversation continuity, speeds up settings updates, and fixes API profiles, Issue Fixer, and auto‑approval behavior.


## QOL Improvements

* Batched settings updates: saves apply faster with less UI flicker across Settings, Auto Approve, Command Execution, and MCP toggles ([#9165](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9165))
* README badges: switched to badgen.net so badges render reliably; Installs and Rating are visible at a glance ([#9200](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9200))

## Bug Fixes

* API Profiles: apply updated headers, baseUrl, service tier, and reasoning budget even when provider/model stay the same ([#9210](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9210))
* Auto-approval: include MCP server state so tool auto-approval works as configured (thanks bozoweed!) ([#9199](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9199))
* Issue Fixer: migrated to GitHub REST + ProjectsV2 to resolve sync errors and restore reliable triage ([#9207](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9207))

## Provider Updates

* Conversation continuity via encrypted reasoning items (OpenAI Responses API): preserves context locally while requests remain stateless for better privacy and reliability; removes previous_response_id complexity ([#9203](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9203))
