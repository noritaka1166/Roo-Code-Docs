# Roo Code 3.38.2 Release Notes (2025-12-31)

This release improves Agent Skills compatibility, clarifies rate-limit status, and updates provider defaults.

## QOL Improvements

* **Agent Skills load more reliably across environments** by aligning skill metadata validation and discovery with the Agent Skills specification. ([#10409](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10409))
* **The recommended onboarding video is easier to find** by updating the “Tutorial & Feature Videos” README section to point to the newer Context Management tutorial (including localized READMEs) (thanks SannidhyaSah!). ([#10375](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10375))

## Bug Fixes

* **Fixes an issue where rate limiting looked like a provider error** so a client-side rate limit now shows as a normal “rate limit wait” status row and completes cleanly. ([#10389](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10389))
* **Fixes an issue where `write_to_file` could create files at an unintended truncated path**, reducing accidental file placement and cleanup. ([#10415](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10415))

## Provider Updates

* **Removes the Human Relay provider** so it no longer appears as a configurable option in Providers. ([#10388](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10388))
* **Updates the Cerebras default max completion tokens to 16,384** to reduce premature rate-limit estimation issues (thanks sebastiand-cerebras!). ([#10387](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10387))
