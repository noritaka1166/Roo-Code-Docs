## Provider Updates

- **Native Tool Calling for OpenAI-compatible Providers**: Enables native tool use with a wider range of models and providers that support the OpenAI format, offering more robust tool interactions in both streaming and non-streaming modes ([#9369](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9369))

## Bug Fixes

- **Native Tool Protocol Race Condition**: Fixed a race condition where switching profiles or changing API configuration could cause tool results to be formatted incorrectly, leading to 400 errors ([#9363](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9363))
- **Native Tool Repetition Detection**: Fixed false positive "stuck in a loop" errors when using native tools repeatedly with different arguments ([#9377](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9377))
- **Strict Native Protocol Parsing**: Ensured no XML parsing occurs when the native protocol is active, preventing model confusion ([#9371](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9371))
- **Prompt Cleanliness**: Removed incompatible XML tool examples from the system prompt when native tool calling is enabled ([#9367](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9367))
- **Gemini Reasoning Config**: Fixed an issue where high/low reasoning effort configuration was not being applied correctly ([#9375](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9375))
- **Gemini Thought Validation**: Resolved integration errors with Gemini reasoning models by correctly handling thought signatures and token counting ([#9380](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9380))
- **Structured JSON Returns**: Updated tools to consistently return structured JSON when using the native protocol ([#9373](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9373))
