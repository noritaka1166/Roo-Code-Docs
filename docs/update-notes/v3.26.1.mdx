## Vercel AI Gateway Provider

We've added Vercel AI Gateway as a complete provider integration (thanks joshualipman123!) ([#7396](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7396), [#7433](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7433)):

- **Full Provider Support**: Use Vercel AI Gateway as a comprehensive AI model provider alongside existing options
- **Model Access**: Access Vercel's wide range of AI models through their optimized gateway infrastructure
- **Embeddings Support**: Includes built-in support for Vercel AI Gateway embeddings ([#7445](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7445))

> **📚 Documentation**: See [Vercel AI Gateway](/providers/vercel-ai-gateway) for detailed setup instructions.
