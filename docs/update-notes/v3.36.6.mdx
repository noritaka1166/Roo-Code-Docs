# Roo Code 3.36.6 Release Notes (2025-12-12)

This release improves follow-up auto-approval behavior, expands tool customization options, and fixes provider settings and error reporting.

## QOL Improvements

* **Clearer auto-approve timing in follow-up suggestions**: Makes the auto-approve countdown harder to miss ([#10048](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10048))

## Bug Fixes

* **Auto-approval stops when you start typing**: Fixes an issue where an auto-approve timer could still fire after you began writing a response ([#9937](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9937))
* **More actionable OpenRouter error messages**: Fixes an issue where failures could show only generic errors by surfacing upstream details when available ([#10039](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10039))
* **LiteLLM tool protocol dropdown always appears**: Restores the tool protocol dropdown in the provider’s Advanced settings even when LiteLLM model metadata isn’t available yet ([#10053](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10053))
* **MCP tool calls work with stricter providers**: Fixes failures caused by special characters in MCP server/tool names by sanitizing names and using an unambiguous `mcp--server--tool` ID format ([#10054](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10054))

## Misc Improvements

* **Tool aliases for model-specific tool naming**: Adds support for alternative tool names so different models can call the same tool using the naming they expect ([#9989](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9989))
* **Workspace task visibility controls for organizations**: Adds an org-level setting for how visible Roo Code Cloud “extension tasks” are across the workspace ([#10020](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10020))
