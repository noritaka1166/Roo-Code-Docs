# Roo Code v3.35.5 Release Notes (2025-12-03)

This release adds provider routing selection for OpenRouter embeddings, updates the CloudView interface, and improves provider compatibility.

## Features

* **OpenRouter Embeddings Provider Routing**: Select specific routing providers for OpenRouter embeddings in code indexing settings, enabling cost optimization since providers can vary by 4-5x in price for the same embedding model (thanks SannidhyaSah!) ([#9693](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9693))

## QOL Improvements

* **CloudView Interface Updates**: Cleaner UI with refreshed marketing copy, updated button styling with rounded corners for a more modern look ([#9776](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9776))

## Provider Updates

* **Roo Provider Tool Compatibility**: Improved tool conversion for OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, ensuring tools work correctly with OpenAI-style request formats ([#9769](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9769))
* **MiniMax M2 Free Tier Default**: MiniMax M2 model now defaults to the free tier when using OpenRouter ([#9778](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9778))
