## Features & Improvements

* **GPT-5.1 in Roo Code** ([#9252](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9252), [#9258](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9258), [#9261](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9261), [#9259](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9259)): Adds all new GPT-5.1 models to the OpenAI Native provider with extended 24‑hour prompt caching support, all new GPT-5.1 models and overall support for 51 throughout other supported providers.

  - **Adaptive reasoning**: GPT-5.1 includes adaptive reasoning that adjusts effort based on task complexity for faster and more efficient results.
  - **Better tone and instruction following**: GPT-5.1 provides improved tone control and stronger instruction following so outputs match your brand voice more naturally.
  - **Stronger software engineering performance**: GPT-5.1 delivers more reliable software engineering performance with better code generation, stronger edge case handling, and improved logic planning.

## Bug Fixes

- **Share button works reliably again**: Fixes the Share button so you can open the share popover and send shared tasks and messages without failures ([#9253](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9253)).

### Misc

- **Release notes are easier to audit**: The internal release guide now requires PR numbers in release notes so each documented change can be traced back to its source PR ([#9236](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9236)).
