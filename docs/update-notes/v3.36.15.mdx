## Vertex AI: 1M context window for Claude Sonnet 4.5

When you use **Claude Sonnet 4.5** on **Vertex AI**, you can now enable a **1M context window** option for supported models ([#10209](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10209)).

## Chat error troubleshooting improvements

Chat error states now make it easier to understand what went wrong and to share the right details when filing a bug report:

* **Clearer error visibility**: Error rows more consistently surface full error details (including status codes) via a more obvious **View details** affordance ([#10204](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10204))
* **Downloadable diagnostics**: You can generate a local diagnostics file from a chat error (including error metadata and the API conversation history) so you can review/redact and share it with an issue report ([#10188](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10188))

## Bug Fixes

* **Native tool calling support for LM Studio and Qwen-Code**: Fixes an issue where these providers were missing OpenAI-style native tool call support, which could make tool use unreliable compared to other providers ([#10208](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10208))
* **More reliable tool defaults for OpenAI Compatible providers**: Fixes cases where tool calling could be inconsistent unless you manually adjusted custom model info, by applying native tool defaults unless you’ve explicitly overridden them ([#10213](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10213))
* **Requesty native tool calls enabled**: Fixes native tool calling defaults for the Requesty provider (and aligns behavior for Unbound) so tool use is more consistent, especially when model metadata is cached ([#10211](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10211))
* **Strict JSON Schema compatibility**: Fixes an issue where some MCP tool schemas could fail strict validation due to missing `additionalProperties: false` on object schemas ([#10210](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10210))
* **Refresh models cache reliability**: Fixes an issue where **Refresh models** could fail to fully flush/refresh cached model lists for some providers, and improves correctness of initial model selection when starting a new task ([#9870](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9870))
