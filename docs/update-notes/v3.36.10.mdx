## Gemini 3 Flash preview model

The `gemini-3-flash-preview` model is now available in the Roo Code Cloud provider, Google Gemini, GCP Vertex AI, Requesty, and OpenRouter providers. It’s the latest model from Google, released this morning (thanks contributors!) ([#10151](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10151)).

## DeepSeek reasoner: interleaved thinking during tool use

The DeepSeek provider’s `deepseek-reasoner` model now supports “interleaved thinking” and native tool calling. In our internal evals, tool calling succeeded 100% of the time, and the extended-run score improved to 93.4% (thanks zbww_!) ([#9969](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9969), [#10141](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10141)).

## Bug Fixes

* **Context truncation token display**: Fixes an issue where the context truncation UI could show incorrect before/after token totals, especially in tool-heavy conversations ([#9961](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9961))

## Misc Improvements

* **Framework updates**: Updates Next.js to `~15.2.8` for improved compatibility with upstream fixes ([#10140](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10140))
