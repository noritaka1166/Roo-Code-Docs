## QOL Improvements

* **Redesigned Message Feed**: Enjoy a cleaner, more readable chat interface with improved visual hierarchy that helps you focus on what matters ([#7985](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7985))
* **Responsive Auto-Approve**: The auto-approve dropdown now adapts to different window sizes with smart 1-2 column layouts, and tooltips show all enabled actions without truncation ([#8032](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8032))
* **Network Resilience**: Telemetry data now automatically retries on network failures, ensuring analytics and diagnostics aren't lost during connectivity issues ([#7597](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7597))

## Bug Fixes

* **Keyboard Shortcut**: Fixed the command+y shortcut in Nightly builds, restoring quick content addition to context ([#8070](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8070))
