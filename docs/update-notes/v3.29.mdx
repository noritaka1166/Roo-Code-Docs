# Roo Code 3.29 Release Notes (2025-10-31)

This combined summary covers the 3.29.x releases. It introduces the MiniMax provider, improves @ file search on large projects, clarifies the Logs tab and VS Code LM guidance, and includes multiple stability fixes.

## Feature Highlights

* Cloud Agent: PR Reviewer for instant high‑quality code reviews (learn more: https://roocode.com/reviewer)
* Intelligent file reading with token‑budget management and a 100 KB preview for very large files ([#8789](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8789))
* MiniMax provider for coding and reasoning with strong Chinese language support and competitive pricing (thanks Maosghoul!) ([#8820](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8820))
* Faster and more reliable @ file search on large repositories with configurable indexing limits and respect for VS Code ignore settings (thanks Naituw!) ([#8805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8805))
* MCP tab renamed to “Logs” to match mixed-level messages (thanks hannesrudolph!) ([#8894](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8894))

## QOL Improvements

* Improve @ file search for large projects; add the roo-cline.maximumIndexedFilesForFileSearch setting with guidance on memory tradeoffs ([#8805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8805))
* Rename MCP “Errors” tab to “Logs” to match info/warning/error messages; clearer empty state (“No logs yet”) ([#8894](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8894))
* Custom modes load from the configured storage path and persist across restarts (thanks elianiva!) ([#8499](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8499))
* Clarify VS Code LM API integration warning in Settings to reduce “model not supported” errors ([#8493](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8493))
* Keyboard shortcut: “Add to Context” moved to avoid Redo conflict; restores standard Redo ([#8653](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8653))
* Auto‑approve button responsiveness improved ([#8798](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8798))
* After “Add to Context,” input auto‑focuses and inserts two newlines to keep typing immediately ([#8877](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8877))

## Bug Fixes

* Reasoning effort selection auto-enables reasoning when needed so UI and behavior stay in sync ([#8890](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8890))
* Suppress noisy cloud‑agent exceptions for cleaner logs ([#8577](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8577))
* Prevent MCP server restart when toggling “Always allow” for MCP tools ([#8633](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8633))
* Reuse existing Qdrant index after outages to avoid full reindex and cut restart time ([#8588](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8588))
* Make code index initialization non‑blocking at activation to avoid startup hangs ([#8933](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8933))
* Honor maxReadFileLine across code definition listing and file reads to prevent context overflows ([#8509](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8509))
* Prevent infinite retry loop when canceling during auto‑retry ([#8902](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8902))
* Gate auth‑driven Roo model refresh to the active provider only to reduce background work ([#8915](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8915))
* search_files now respects .gitignore (including nested) by default; override when needed ([#8804](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8804))
* apply_diff export preserves trailing newlines (fix stripLineNumbers) ([#8227](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8227))
* Fix provider model loading race conditions to reduce timeouts and intermittent errors ([#8836](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8836))
* Rate limiting now uses a monotonic clock and enforces a hard cap to avoid long lockouts ([#8456](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8456))
* Messages typed during context condensing now send automatically once condensing finishes; per‑task queues no longer cross‑drain ([#8478](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8478))
* Checkpoint menu popover no longer clips long option text; items remain fully visible ([#8867](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8867))

## Provider Updates

* MiniMax provider added (MiniMax‑M2) with API key setup and model selection in UI ([#8820](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8820))
* Cerebras: add zai‑glm‑4.6 and change default to gpt‑oss‑120b; deprecate qwen‑3‑coder models ([#8920](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8920))
* Roo Code Cloud: dynamic model loading in the Model Picker with caching and graceful fallback ([#8728](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8728))
* Chutes AI: LongCat‑Flash‑Thinking‑FP8 models (200K, 128K) for longer coding sessions ([#8426](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8426))
* OpenRouter: add Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 to prompt‑caching models ([#8764](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8764))

* Roo provider: Reasoning effort control to choose deeper thinking vs. faster/cheaper ([#8874](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8874))
* OpenAI‑compatible: centralized ~20% maxTokens cap to prevent context overruns ([#8822](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/8822))
