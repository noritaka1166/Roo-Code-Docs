# Roo Code 3.41.2 Release Notes (2026-01-16)

This patch release makes long markdown replies easier to read, fixes OpenAI Codex setup issues, and improves Gemini compatibility in LiteLLM.

## Open markdown replies in VS Code preview

Markdown responses in chat can now be opened directly in VS Code’s Markdown Preview, making longer formatted replies easier to read and navigate without scrolling through the chat bubble. ([#10773](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10773))

## Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where OpenAI – ChatGPT Plus/Pro could incorrectly require an API key during setup, blocking you on provider selection even though it uses OAuth sign-in. ([#10786](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10786))
* Fixes an issue where the OpenAI Codex provider could keep an invalid model selection after switching providers, restoring a valid model choice automatically. ([#10777](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10777))

## Provider Updates

* Fixes an issue where Gemini requests routed through LiteLLM could fail when the model name contained spaces, improving compatibility for Gemini model group naming. ([#10787](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/10787))
