# Roo Code 3.31.1 Release Notes (2025-11-12)

This release highlights a refreshed button look across the UI, improves auto-approvals reliability, prevents cloud tasks from stalling, keeps model profiles in sync on switch, and adds an IPC command to post messages into the current task.

## New Button Look

A consistent, rounded Button component with clear variants and sizes now appears across the UI. The result is a cleaner, more modern interface with predictable interactions where buttons are used ([#9150](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9150)).

## Features

* IPC command to send messages (text/images) to the current task for automations and richer context ([#9149](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9149))

## QOL Improvements

* Move auto-approval logic from ChatView to Task for more reliable handling and clearer UI safeguards ([#9157](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9157))

## Bug Fixes

* Prevent command_output asks from blocking in cloud/headless environments, so tasks no longer stall ([#9152](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9152))
* Ensure model switch re-applies the selected profile so task configuration stays in sync ([#9181](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/9181))
