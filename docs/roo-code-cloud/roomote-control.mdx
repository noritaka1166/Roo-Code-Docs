# Roomote Control

Roomote Control lets you remotely control tasks running in your local VS Code instance from the Roo Code Cloud web interface – on desktop or mobile – and far away from your computer. This feature is available in our [paid plans](https://roocode.com/pricing).

It creates a bidirectional connection between your local VS Code extension and Roo Code Cloud so you can:

- Keep working on long-running tasks after you step away from your computer
- Start tasks remotely, including from your phone
- Answer questions and ensure Roo doesn't get stuck
- Receive push notifications about task progress and questions from Roo
- Get the most from the extension without having any code leave your computer

Think of it as a halfway point between autonomous [Cloud Agents](/roo-code-cloud/cloud-agents) and overseeing Roo in the extension.

## Key Features

- **Chat interface** — Similar to IDE chat for core interactions; some settings and customizations aren't available in the browser
- **Start New Tasks** — Launch tasks in any connected workspace
- **Stop Running Tasks** — Safely terminate active tasks
- **Task Switching** — Navigate between tasks including resuming tasks that have been stopped or closed
- Single active task per workspace is enforced

:::note Requirements
- A paid plan
- Task Sync must be enabled
- Remote Control must be enabled
- Your IDE must be running and connected to the internet
- Only one task can be active per workspace at a time – but you can have as many workspaces open as you want (or your computer can handle)

## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Connect Your Account

Connect your Roo Code extension to Roo Code Cloud. Follow [Connect the Extension to Cloud](/roo-code-cloud/connect#quickstart) or [Login/Signup](/roo-code-cloud/login).

#### Step 2: Upgrade to a paid plan

Go to [Upgrade](https://app.roocode.com/billing), choose your plan and follow the instructions.

#### Step 3: Ensure Task Sync and Roomote Control are enabled

You should have them on by default, but if not:
- In the IDE: Click the cloud icon <Codicon name="cloud" /> and toggle Task Sync first, then Roomote Control in the Cloud panel.

- In the web app: Go to Settings › User and toggle Task Sync and Roomote Control. You may also see inline "Enable …" banners on Home/Task pages.

#### Step 4: Start a Remote Task

When connected and enabled:
1. Your VS Code workspace(s) appear in the web app.
2. Click New Task on a connected workspace card.
3. Enter a task description and click Start.
4. Watch progress and interact in real time.

If "New Task" is disabled, upgrade/enable in Settings › User › Roomote Control.

## Notifications

You can enable Push Notifications in the web app under Settings to be notified of progress on your tasks.

## Permissions & Security

- All communications are encrypted
- Only the user who created a task can interact with it from the browser (send messages, approve/deny)
- Team admins can disable Roomote Control for the account
