## Authentication Security

Roo Code Cloud uses industry-standard OAuth with GitHub and Google, plus traditional email authentication to ensure secure access to your account:

- **OAuth 2.0 Protocol** - Secure authentication through trusted providers (GitHub and Google)
- **No Password Storage** - When using OAuth, Roo Code never stores your GitHub or Google passwords
- **Encrypted Connections** - All authentication requests use HTTPS encryption
- **Token-Based Access** - Secure tokens manage your session without exposing credentials
- **Email Authentication** - Traditional email/password option with secure password hashing
