## Getting Started

To connect your extension to Roo Code Cloud:

1. Go to the  **Cloud** <Codicon name="cloud" /> tab in the top right corner of the Roo Code extension.
   <img src="/img/login/login-0.png" alt="Tab location in the extension" width="400" />
2. Click on the big blue button (and click on "Open" if asked).
3. Sign up for or sign in to your account, using the auth method of your choice
4. Review and accept the terms of service and privacy policy

6. You'll be logged in

## Troubleshooting

If you're not taken to your IDE, from this screen:

<img src="/img/login/login-11.png" alt="IDE selector for VS Code forks" width="500" />

You can:
- Click on the logo for your IDE (eg VS Code, Trae, Cursor) and see if the popup appears, or
- Copy the URL from the box below and, in the extension, click on "Having Trouble?" and paste it in

Your Roo Code VS Code extension is now connected to Roo Code Cloud and ready to sync your data and enable collaboration features.

If you never even see the screen above, go back to the extension, click on "Start Over" and try again. It should work now.

## Authentication Security

Roo Code Cloud uses industry-standard OAuth with GitHub and Google, plus traditional email authentication to ensure secure access to your account:

- **OAuth 2.0 Protocol** - Secure authentication through trusted providers (GitHub and Google)
- **No Password Storage** - When using OAuth, Roo Code never stores your GitHub or Google passwords
- **Encrypted Connections** - All authentication requests use HTTPS encryption
- **Token-Based Access** - Secure tokens manage your session without exposing credentials
- **Email Authentication** - Traditional email/password option with secure password hashing
