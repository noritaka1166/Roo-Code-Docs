# Roo Code Cloud Overview

Roo Code Cloud transforms AI development with autonomous [Cloud Agents](/roo-code-cloud/cloud-agents) that work independently in the cloud. Instead of just assisting you in your editor, these agents can plan, code, review, and fix issues autonomously, accessible directly from **GitHub PRs**, **Slack messages**, or the **web browser**.

It also augments the Roo Code VS Code extension capabilities by adding:
- [Task Sync](/roo-code-cloud/task-sync) to access your entire task history in one place
- [Task sharing](/roo-code-cloud/task-sharing) to access specific tasks with friends or co-workers
- [Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control) to start/stop and control tasks in the Extension while away from your computer
- [Token usage analytics](/roo-code-cloud/analytics) to understand where your tokens and dollars are going

And, in the Team plan, adds team-oriented features:
- Team-wide analytics
- Centralized provider settings and other configuration
- Shared access to the same Cloud Agent team
