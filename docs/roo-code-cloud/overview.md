# Roo Code Cloud Overview

Roo Code Cloud transforms AI development with autonomous [Cloud Agents](./cloud-agents) that work independently in the cloud. Instead of just assisting you in your editor, these agents can plan, code, review, and fix issues autonomously, accessible directly from **GitHub PRs**, **Slack messages**, or the **web browser**.

It also augments the Roo Code VS Code extension capabilities by adding:
- Access to the [Roo Code Cloud Provider](/roo-code-provider/overview)
- [Task Sync](./task-sync) to access your entire task history in one place
- [Task sharing](./task-sharing) to access specific tasks with friends or co-workers
- [Roomote Control](./roomote-control) to start/stop and control tasks in the Extension while away from your computer
- [Token usage analytics](./analytics) to understand where your tokens and dollars are going

And, in the [Team plan](./team-plan), adds team-oriented features:
- Centralized LLM inference billing without managing API keys (with the [Roo Code Cloud Provider](/roo-code-provider/overview))
- Team-wide task history and token usage analytics
- Shared Cloud Agent team (with centralized billing)
- Centralized integration with Github and Slack (not one per user)
- Extension configuration enforcement (providers/models, MCP servers and more)

## Getting Started

To use it, you'll need an account. You can:
- **[Directly sign up for a Roo Code account](https://app.roocode.com/sign-up)** and set up your agent team
- Or  **[sign up for a Roo Code account from the VS Code extension](/roo-code-cloud/login)** to your account

If you chose the Roo Code Cloud Provider when signing up, you already have an account and only need to sign in.
