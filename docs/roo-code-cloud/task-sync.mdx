# Task Sync/Monitoring

Task Sync streams task activity from your local VS Code to Roo Code Cloud so you can monitor progress from any device and access tasks later. This feature is free for all users.

It creates a live, one-way stream of your task messages and status from your local VS Code to Roo Code Cloud so you can:
- Monitor long-running tasks from your phone while away from your desk
- See near real-time updates (polled every few seconds): messages, mode changes, and status
- Check when a task completes without sitting in front of your IDE
- Review your cloud task history anytime

Keep in mind Task Sync sends tasks from your IDE to Roo Code Cloud, but not vice-versa. For example, it doesn't sync tasks across devices at the moment.

## Getting Started

1. [Connect your IDE](/roo-code-cloud/connect) (or see [Login/Signup](/roo-code-cloud/login))
2. Open or start a task in your local Roo Code extension
3. Visit the homescreen at https://app.roocode.com to monitor in near real time

- Personal accounts: Task Sync is enabled by default and can be toggled in Settings.
- Organization accounts: Task Sync is managed by your org admins and is off by default for members unless enabled at the org level.

## Limitations

- One-way monitoring only; no cloud commands are sent to your IDE
- For live updates, your IDE must be open and connected
- Internet connection required for live updates

You can review cloud task history anytime, even when your IDE is closed.

## Privacy & Security

- Your data is never used for training or advertising purposes
- The Roo Code team doesn't have access to the contents of your tasks, unless explicitly authorized by you to debug any issues
