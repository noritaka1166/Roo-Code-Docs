# Team Plan

The team plan is designed for teams to work together using the Roo Code suite, be it the Extension, Cloud or a combination of both.

It allows for:
- Centralized LLM inference billing without managing API keys (with [Roo Code Router](/roo-code-router/overview))
- Team-wide task history and token usage analytics
- Shared Cloud Agent team (with centralized billing)
- Centralized integration with Github and Slack (not one per user)
- Extension configuration enforcement (providers/models, MCP servers and more)

## Access

You can access Team functionality by starting a free 14-day trial.

If you already have a Roo Code Cloud account, you can [upgrade here](https://app.roocode.com/checkout/team). If you don't, sign up from our [pricing page](https://roocode.com/pricing).


## Capabilities

Most of the team functionality can be accessed from your [Organization Settings](https://app.roocode.com/) page (from your user avatar menu)
