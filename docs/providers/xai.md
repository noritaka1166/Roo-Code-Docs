# Using xAI (Grok) With Roo Code

xAI is the company behind Grok, a large language model known for its conversational abilities and large context window. Grok models are designed to provide helpful, informative, and contextually relevant responses.

## Reasoning Capabilities

Grok 3 Mini models feature specialized reasoning capabilities, allowing them to "think before responding" - particularly useful for complex problem-solving tasks.

### Reasoning-Enabled Models

Several Grok models have reasoning capabilities. However, only the Grok 3 Mini models support configurable reasoning effort control:

* `grok-3-mini` - Supports reasoning effort control
* `grok-3-mini-fast` - Supports reasoning effort control

Other models (`grok-code-fast-1`, `grok-4.1-fast`, `grok-4`, `grok-3`, `grok-3-fast`) are reasoning-capable but don't expose the `reasoning_effort` parameter.

### Controlling Reasoning Effort

When using reasoning-enabled models, you can control how hard the model thinks with the `reasoning_effort` parameter:

* `low`: Minimal thinking time, using fewer tokens for quick responses
* `high`: Maximum thinking time, leveraging more tokens for complex problems

Choose `low` for simple queries that should complete quickly, and `high` for harder problems where response latency is less important.

### Key Features

* **Step-by-Step Problem Solving**: The model thinks through problems methodically before delivering an answer
* **Math & Quantitative Strength**: Excels at numerical challenges and logic puzzles
* **Reasoning Trace Access**: The model's thinking process is available via the `reasoning_content` field in the response completion object

## Prompt Caching

Prompt caching is available for select Grok models including `grok-code-fast-1`, `grok-4`, `grok-3`, `grok-3-fast`, `grok-3-mini`, and `grok-3-mini-fast`. This feature can reduce costs and improve response times.
