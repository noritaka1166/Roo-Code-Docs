# Model Providers

The Roo Code VS Code extension and Roo Code Cloud Agents are highly capable, sophisticated coding agents. While they carry a lot of functionality on their own, they depend on LLM providers to offer the inference needed to complete tasks.

Other tools are intinsically bound by design to a specific provider (like Claude Code → Anthropic Models or Codex → OpenAI models), forcing you to stick with them irrespective of how the landscape changes (which happens fast). Roo on the other hand is **model-agnostic**, allowing you to choose the model that best fits your needs, according to your budget, skill profile, codebase and more.

So we support connting to a wide range of model providers, giving you flexibility in how you access AI models. Some providers work with the VS Code extension, while others are available through Roo Code Cloud Agents.
