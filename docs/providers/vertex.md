# Using GCP Vertex AI With Roo Code

Roo Code supports accessing models through Google Cloud Platform's Vertex AI, a managed machine learning platform that provides access to various foundation models, including Anthropic's Claude family.

**Website:** [https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)

---

## Prerequisites

*   **Google Cloud Account:** You need an active Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
*   **Project:** You need a GCP project with the Vertex AI API enabled.
*   **Model Access:** You must request and be granted access to the specific Claude models on Vertex AI you want to use. See the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude#before_you_begin) for instructions.
*   **Application Default Credentials (ADC):**  Roo Code uses Application Default Credentials to authenticate with Vertex AI. The easiest way to set this up is to:
    1.  Install the Google Cloud CLI: [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    2.  Authenticate using: `gcloud auth application-default login`
*   **Service Account Key (Alternative):** Alternatively, you can authenticate using a Google Cloud Service Account key file. You'll need to generate this key in your GCP project. See the [Google Cloud documentation on creating service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

## Available Models

Roo Code supports all models available through Google Cloud Vertex AI, including Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and MAAS (Model as a Service) offerings.

For the complete, up-to-date model list and IDs, see [Vertex AI's models documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models).

## Configuration in Roo Code

1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name="gear" />) in the Roo Code panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "GCP Vertex AI" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Configure Authentication:**
    
    Roo Code uses the following authentication priority:
    1. **Google Cloud Credentials (JSON):** If provided, this takes precedence
    2. **Google Cloud Key File Path:** If provided and no JSON credentials, this is used
    3. **Application Default Credentials (ADC):** Used as fallback when neither above is provided
    
    **Option 1 - Using ADC (Simplest):**
    *   Install the Google Cloud CLI and run `gcloud auth application-default login`
    *   No further configuration needed in Roo Code
    
    **Option 2 - Using Service Account Key:**
    *   Either paste the JSON content directly into **Google Cloud Credentials** field
    *   Or provide the file path in **Google Cloud Key File Path** field

4.  **Enter Project ID:** Enter your Google Cloud Project ID.
5.  **Select Region:** Choose the region where your Vertex AI resources are located (e.g., `us-east5`).
6.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.

## Advanced Features

### Gemini-Specific Features

When using Gemini models through Vertex AI, additional grounding features become available:

#### URL Context

Enable URL context to allow Gemini models to access and analyze web content directly. This feature allows Roo to:

- Read and understand web pages in real-time
- Analyze documentation from URLs
- Review online code repositories
- Access current information from websites

**Enabling URL Context:**
1. Select a Gemini model in your Vertex AI configuration
2. Enable the "URL Context" option that appears
3. Save your settings

#### Google Search Grounding

Enable Google Search grounding to enhance Gemini's responses with real-time search results. This provides:

- Up-to-date information from web searches
- Fact-checking capabilities
- Current event awareness
- Enhanced accuracy for technical queries

**Enabling Search Grounding:**
1. Select a Gemini model in your Vertex AI configuration
2. Enable the "Google Search Grounding" option that appears
3. Save your settings

:::note
URL Context and Google Search Grounding options only appear when a Gemini model is selected. These features may incur additional costs.
