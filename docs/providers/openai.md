## Advanced Features

### Reasoning Effort Control

For models that support reasoning (GPT-5, o1, o3, o4 families), you can control how deeply the model thinks:

**GPT-5 Models:**
- `minimal` - Fastest responses with basic reasoning
- `low` - Quick responses with light reasoning
- `medium` (default) - Balanced reasoning and response time
- `high` - Deep reasoning for complex problems

**o1/o3/o4 Models:**
- `low` - Minimal thinking time
- `medium` - Balanced approach
- `high` - Maximum thinking for complex problems

Some models have preset reasoning levels that cannot be changed.

### Verbosity Control

Available for GPT-5 models and select others, verbosity controls the detail level of responses:

- `low` - Concise, direct responses
- `medium` (default) - Balanced detail
- `high` - Comprehensive, detailed responses

### Temperature Settings

Temperature controls output randomness (0.0 to 2.0):

- **GPT-5 models:** Default 1.0 for balanced creativity
- **Other models:** Default 0.0 for deterministic output
- **Note:** Not available for o1/o3 reasoning models

### Conversation Continuity (GPT-5)

GPT-5 models maintain conversation context efficiently through response IDs, reducing token usage while preserving context. This happens automatically - no configuration needed.

## Tips and Notes

*   **Pricing:** Refer to the [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) page for current model costs and discounts, including prompt caching.
*   **Azure OpenAI Service:** If you'd like to use the Azure OpenAI service, please see our section on [OpenAI-compatible](/providers/openai-compatible) providers.
*   **Context Optimization:** For GPT-5-Codex, leverage prompt caching by maintaining consistent context across requests to reduce costs significantly.
