# Roo Code Router

To make it as smooth as possible to use Roo Code, which depends on a provider service for LLM inference, we've built the Roo Code Router.

There's no need for a separate subscription or managing API keys. It's fully integrated into our suite of products and easy to get started. It features:

- Vetted premium coding models, and sometimes free models (depending on vendor availability)
- Only models tested to work well with Roo
- Paid models provided at cost, with no mark-up
- The same pre-paid credit mechanism you'll use for Roo Code Cloud Agents
