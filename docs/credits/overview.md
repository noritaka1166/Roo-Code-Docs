# Roo Code Credits Overview

Roo Code is composed of a few products:
- **Roo Code VS Code** (the extension) is 100% free
- **Roo Code Cloud Provider** (the model provider) offers both free and paid models
- **Roo Code Cloud Agents** (the automous agents) are a paid feature as they incur infrastructure costs

In order to use paid models via our provider and to run Cloud agents, you need credits.

## What are credits?

Credits are just pre-paid dollar amounts you can optionally buy to use the paid parts of the Roo Code suite. If you stick to free features and free models, you don't have to buy any credits.

Credits are shown in dollars, there's no shenanigans in converting it to obscure currencies you can't calculate.


## How much do credits cost?

Our [pricing page](https://roocode.com/pricing) always has the latest on our plans and Cloud Agent pricing.

Model pricing can be found in the [provider page](https://roocode.com/provider) of our website.

We don't include prices here just to make sure they're always up-to-date.

If you change your mind, just follow the same steps while turning it off.
