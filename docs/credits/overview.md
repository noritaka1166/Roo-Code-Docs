# Roo Code Credits Overview

Roo Code is composed of a few products:
- **Roo Code VS Code** (the extension) is 100% free
- **Roo Code Router** (the model provider) offers both free and paid models
- **Roo Code Cloud Agents** (the automous agents) are a paid feature as they incur infrastructure costs

In order to use paid models via our provider and to run Cloud agents, you need credits.

## What are credits?

Credits are just pre-paid dollar amounts you can optionally buy to use the paid parts of the Roo Code suite. If you stick to free features and use free models, you don't have to buy any credits.

Credits are shown in dollars, there's no shenanigans in converting it to obscure currencies you can't calculate.


## How much do credits cost?

Our [pricing page](https://roocode.com/pricing) always has the latest on our plans and Cloud Agent pricing.

Model pricing can be found in the [provider page](https://roocode.com/provider) of our website.

We don't include prices here just to make sure they're always up-to-date.

## How are credits and the monthly subscription related?

The monthly subscription to the Team plan simply unlocks advanced functionality. It doesn't include any credits. And the free plan doesn't have any recurring subscription fees, you only pay for the credits you purchase.

## How do I get free credits or free minutes or free tokens?

When you sign up for a Roo Code Cloud account, you'll be given a number of "Free Minutes" to try the product out (you'll see a cute <LucideIcon name="Gift" style={{ width: 14, position: "relative", top: 4}} /> icon). Those free minutes cover both the [Cloud Agent](/roo-code-cloud/cloud-agents) run time _and_ inference via the Roo Code Cloud provider (both of which normally cost credits). Those can't be used in the extension – they're there for you to try the magic of Cloud Agents.

If you want free inference in the extension, look for a free model when available (or use another provider which may offer it to you for free).

## How can I buy credits?

### Single purchase

### Auto top-up

To make sure you never run out of credits, you can set up Auto top-up:

1. Click on the same credit balance display

2. Click on the ⚡ icon
    <img src="/img/credits/auto-top-up-1.png" alt="Credit balance dropdown" width="280" />

3. Enable the option and configure the threshold and amount to buy
4. Click save and you're done

If you change your mind, just follow the same steps while turning it off.
