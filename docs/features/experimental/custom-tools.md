# Custom Tools

Define TypeScript or JavaScript tools that Roo can call like built-in tools—standardize team workflows instead of re-prompting the same steps every task.

:::warning Experimental Feature
Custom tools is an experimental feature. Custom tools are **automatically approved** when enabled—Roo won't ask for permission before running them. Only enable this feature if you trust your tool code.
:::

---

## What it does

Custom tools let you codify project-specific actions into TypeScript/JavaScript files that Roo calls like [`read_file()`](/basic-usage/how-tools-work) or [`execute_command()`](/basic-usage/how-tools-work). Ship tool schemas alongside your repo so teammates don't need to keep re-explaining the same workflow steps. Tools are validated with Zod and automatically transpiled from TypeScript.

---

## How to create a tool

Tools live in `.roo/tools/` (project-specific) or `~/.roo/tools/` (global) as `.ts` or `.js` files. Tools from later directories can override earlier ones.

#### Basic structure

```typescript
import { parametersSchema as z, defineCustomTool } from "@roo-code/types"

export default defineCustomTool({
  name: "tool_name",
  description: "What the tool does (shown to AI)",
  parameters: z.object({
    param1: z.string().describe("Parameter description"),
    param2: z.number().describe("Another parameter"),
  }),
  async execute(args, context) {
    // args are type-safe and validated
    // context provides: mode, task
    return "Result string shown to AI"
  }
})
```

#### What you define

- **`name`**: Tool name Roo sees in its available tools list
- **`description`**: Shown to the AI so it knows when to call the tool
- **`parameters`**: Zod schema converted to JSON Schema for validation
- **`execute`**: Async function returning a string result to Roo

Tools are dynamically loaded and transpiled with esbuild. Automatic reload on file changes isn't reliable—use the **Refresh Custom Tools** command to pick up changes immediately.

## Enabling the feature

1. Open Roo Code settings (gear icon in top right)
2. Go to the "Experimental" tab
3. Toggle "Enable custom tools"

**Critical:** When enabled, custom tools are **auto-approved**—Roo runs them without asking. Disable if you don't trust the tool code.

---

## Tool directories

- **`.roo/tools/`** in your workspace: project-specific tools shared with your team
- **`~/.roo/tools/`** in your home folder: personal tools across all projects

Tools from both directories are loaded. Tools with the same name in `.roo/tools/` override those in `~/.roo/tools/`.

---

## Using npm Dependencies

Custom tools can use npm packages. Install dependencies in the same folder as your tool, and imports will resolve normally.

```bash
# From your tool directory
cd .roo/tools/
npm init -y
npm install axios lodash
```

Then import in your tool:

```typescript
import { parametersSchema as z, defineCustomTool } from "@roo-code/types"
import axios from "axios"

export default defineCustomTool({
  name: "fetch_api",
  description: "Fetch data from an API endpoint",
  parameters: z.object({
    url: z.string().describe("API endpoint URL"),
  }),
  async execute({ url }) {
    const response = await axios.get(url)
    return JSON.stringify(response.data, null, 2)
  }
})
```

## Per-Tool Environment Variables

Roo copies `.env` and `.env.*` files from your tool directory into the tool's cache folder so your tool can load them at runtime. **Roo does not automatically inject these variables into `process.env`**—your tool must load them itself.

**Setup:**

1. Create a `.env` file next to your tool:
   ```
   .roo/tools/
   ├── my-tool.ts
   ├── .env          # Copied to cache dir at load time
   └── package.json
   ```

2. Add your secrets:
   ```bash
   # .roo/tools/.env
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX
   API_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

3. Load the `.env` in your tool using `dotenv` and `__dirname`:
   ```typescript
   import { parametersSchema as z, defineCustomTool } from "@roo-code/types"
   import dotenv from "dotenv"
   import path from "path"

   // Load .env from the tool's cache directory
   dotenv.config({ path: path.join(__dirname, ".env") })

   export default defineCustomTool({
     name: "notify_slack",
     description: "Send a notification to Slack",
     parameters: z.object({
       message: z.string().describe("Message to send"),
     }),
     async execute({ message }) {
       const webhookUrl = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
       if (!webhookUrl) {
         return "Error: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL not set in .env"
       }
       
       const response = await fetch(webhookUrl, {
         method: "POST",
         headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
         body: JSON.stringify({ text: message }),
       })
       
       return response.ok ? "Message sent" : `Failed: ${response.status}`
     }
   })
   ```

**Why `__dirname`?** Roo copies your `.env` files into a cache directory alongside the transpiled tool. Using `__dirname` ensures your tool finds the `.env` in the correct location regardless of where the tool was originally defined.

**Security:** Ensure your `.env` file is ignored by version control to keep secrets safe.

## Limits

- **No approval prompts**: Tools are auto-approved when the feature is enabled—security trade-off for convenience
- **String-only results**: Tools must return strings (Roo's protocol constraint)
- **No interactive input**: Tools can't prompt the user mid-execution
- **Cache invalidation**: Tool updates may require reloading the window

**vs. MCP:** [MCP](/features/mcp/overview) is for external services (search, APIs). Custom tools are for in-repo logic you control directly. MCP is more extensible; custom tools are lighter weight for project-specific actions.
